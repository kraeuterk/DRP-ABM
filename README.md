# DRP-ABM
This repository contains files from a Directed Reading Program project on agent-based modeling. 

# Overview
“The Directed Reading Program (DRP) is a student mentorship initiative jointly run by the math departments at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. It pairs undergraduates with graduate student mentors to explore advanced mathematical topics through weekly meetings and independent reading over the course of a semester.  
...  

DRP students will meet weekly with their graduate student mentor for about an hour and spend approximately four additional hours each week on independent reading. At the end of the semester, all participants will give a short (15-minute) presentation at a mini-symposium to share what they’ve learned.”

# Our Goals 
* Learn about agent-based modeling (ABM) and its advantages
* Learn how to develop an ABM using NetLogo
* Learn how ABM has been used in mathematical biology research 

# Summary of Our Progress
Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational approach to studying emergent output of complex systems. We reviewed Chapters 1 - X of Railsback and Grimm (2019) for an introduction to ABM and the ABM software NetLogo. Textbook example models provided practice with NetLogo coding and general modeling strategies. We then developed a user-friendly Rock-Paper-Scissors simulator using NetLogo. Transitioning into the realm of Mathematical Biology (an area that benefits from the use of ABM due to the complex nature of biological systems), we developed a first version of a generalized tumor microenvironment ABM.
